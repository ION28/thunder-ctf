<p>For each level of this ctf, you will be tasked with exploiting various vulnerable cloud infrastructure in order to find the "secret" of each level, which is a large integer stored somewhere in the infrastructure</p>
<p>The secret for this level is in a file in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. On level creation, you are given the bucket name and, it is written to start/a1openbucket.txt</p>
---
<p>List the bucket's contents</p>
---
<p>The command to do so is:</p>
<pre>gsutil ls gs://[bucket-name]</pre>
---
<p>Download the secret file</p>
---
<p>The command to do so is:</p>
<pre>gsutil cp gs://[bucket-name]/secret.txt</pre>
